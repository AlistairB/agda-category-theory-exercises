* Exercies for Category Theory in Agda
  These exercises are meant as a companion to the series of
  pseudo-lectures I will be running on my twitch channel
  (https://www.twitch.tv/totbwf), every Monday at 5pm PST.

  However, I will not be giving an introduction to agda, as Philip Wadler
  has done a much better job than I could ever hope to!
  The first few parts of Section 1 of 'Programming Language Foundations in Agda'
  form an excellent introduction to the language. It can be found at:
  https://plfa.github.io/#part-1-logical-foundations

  *Please* do not post solutions to these exercises online. Doing so
   gives others an out when they get momentarily stuck, which is when
   a lot of learning happens. If you do get really stuck, feel free to
   reach out to me on the FP Slack (TOTBWF at https://fpchat-invite.herokuapp.com/),
   Zulip (Reed Mullanix on https://funprog.zulipchat.com), or shoot me
   an email.
