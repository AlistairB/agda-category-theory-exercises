-- These are the exercises for my first "pseudolecture" on category theory.
-- We are going to be using agda for the exercises, as I find it provides
-- really nice feedback on whether or not you are on the right track.
-- However, I will not be giving an introduction to agda, as Philip Wadler
-- has done a much better job than I could ever hope to!
-- The first few parts of Section 1 of 'Programming Language Foundations in Agda'
-- form an excellent introduction to the language. It can be found at:

--
-- There are ways around this, and we will get to them later, but for now, let's simply
-- postulate that two functions are equal if we can show that they return the same value
-- for every possible input.
